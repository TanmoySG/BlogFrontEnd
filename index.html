                            Something has always existed. According to physics, there can never be true physical
                            nothingness—though there can be times when existence resembles nothing, such as a vacuum
                            (the
                            state of minimum possible energy) (Phys.org). Creating a space where there are no quantum
                            fluctuations requires an enormous amount of energy, and there would be a remnant of that
                            energy
                            in that space afterwards if the fluctuations were flushed out, plus an unstable environment
                            (1veritasium). Even on computers, deleted data is not actually tossed away, by rather
                            written
                            over. The fact that there can never be nothingness means the universe, and anything possibly
                            beyond it, is eternal, as something has always been around. Whatever we consider to be
                            before
                            the Big Bang—God, the universe in infinitesimal form, or both—one thing is certain: it was
                            there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consider that for a moment: everything we see around us is assumed to have had a cause and
                            is
                            contingent upon something else. However, when it comes to existence itself, it takes on the
                            opposite. It’s mind boggling to think that something has always been and always will be. It
                            goes
                            contrary to what we experience in our lives. But somehow, it’s possible. It also implies
                            that
                            cause is a misnomer: if existence is eternal, then cause is not all that important.
                            Existence,
                            without a beginning or end, continues to change its form. In addition, the concept of time
                            has
                            to be thrown out as well if we consider the nature of the universe. Without a beginning or
                            end
                            to existence, time is rendered irrelevant. Sure, it is a useful tool in our daily lives, but
                            it
                            is not a universal fact. Time is just our perception of duration within an eternal universe.

                        <p>
                            An essential question is why existence is boundless. We can say, “that is the way it is,”
                            but
                            that’s not so satisfying to hear—especially for someone who is inquisitive. Well, the human
                            mind
                            deals in duality in order to perceive the world, and we think if we were born, then the
                            universe
                            must have had a beginning (Parvez, Hanan). But the universe doesn’t have to conform to the
                            human
                            mind. We are often too egocentric to see past our limited capabilities. In fact, you and I
                            were
                            never born—not exactly. Each of us were formed out of existing matter and energy (Johnston,
                            Ian). You didn’t poof into existence, and no thing ever has. Matter and energy transitions,
                            rather than get created or destroyed (Kaunana). People talk about the universe being “born”
                            like
                            it was a magic show or a miracle, but even the universe as we know it was present before the
                            Big
                            Bang. Live Science states that, “Rewind far enough (about 13.8 billion years), and the
                            entire
                            universe shrinks to the size of a single atom, Hawking said. This subatomic ball of
                            everything
                            is known as the singularity (not to be confused with the technological singularity during
                            which
                            artificial intelligence will overtake humans). Inside this extremely small, massively dense
                            speck of heat and energy, the laws of physics and time as we know them cease to function”
                            (Specktor, Brandon). In the same article, Stephen Hawking is quoted as saying, “It was
                            always
                            reaching closer to nothing but didn’t become nothing. There was never a Big Bang that
                            produced
                            something from nothing. It just seemed that way from mankind’s point of perspective.”

                            It’s possible for the universe to be eternal, and whatever might be beyond the universe as
                            well
                            (if that’s on the table), because there is no other way it can be. It’s impossible for
                            existence
                            itself to have a precedent. Birth and death are illusions. As soon we look beyond the
                            confines
                            of our minds, we’ll see reality.
